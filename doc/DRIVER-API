DRIVER-API

A driver is a backend storage which is used to read and write the data used by
the plugin.

The current driver is set by the option 'forward_driver' defined in the plugin
configuration file 'config.inc.php'. A driver can have his own settings in the
configuration file.

Coding a driver is very easy. His source filename must correspond to his name.
Two functions need to be implemented : forward_read and forward_write. The
first read data and the second write them.

API :

- forward_read(array &$data)

     This function reads the data and store them in the array given in
     argument.
 
- forward_write(array &$data)

     This function writes the data from the array given in argument.
     
     Each function must return a status code which can be :
     - PLUGIN_SUCCESS : success status.
     - PLUGIN_ERROR_DEFAULT : status for generic error.
     - PLUGIN_ERROR_CONNECT : status for connection error.
     - PLUGIN_ERROR_PROCESS : status for processing error.

     The array of data contains values with specific keys. Each value can be
     get and/or set :
     - username : string, username or email (get).
     - email : string, email of the user if username is a full email (get/set).
     - email_local : string, email local part if username is a full email (get/set).
     - email_domain : string, email domain if username is a full email (get/set).
     - forward_enable : boolean, flag to enable/disable the forward message
       (get/set).
     - forward_start : integer, timestamp/date of the forward start (get/set)
     - forward_end : integer, timestamp/date of the forward end (get/set)
     - forward_subject : string, subject of the forward message (get/set).
     - forward_message : string, message of the forward (get/set).
     - forward_keepcopyininbox, boolean, flag to enable/disable the forward keep
       copy in inbox flag (get/set).
     - forward_forwarder : string, forward address of the forward (get/set).


SAMPLE CODE :

This following code is a sample driver which do nothing.

/*
 * A sample driver which do nothing.
 *
 * /lib/drivers/nothing.php
 *
 */

/*
 * Reads data.
 *
 * @param $data array the array of data to set/get.
 *
 * @return integer the status code.
 */
function forward_read(array &$data)
{
    // get a driver option
    $rcmail = rcmail::get_instance();
    $driver_option = $rcmail->config->get('forward_myoption');

    // get an input data
    $email = $data['user_username'];

    /*
     * driver read all needed data and store them in $data (output values)
     */

    return PLUGIN_SUCCESS;
}

/*
 * Reads data.
 *
 * @param $data array the array of data to set/get.
 *
 * @return integer the status code.
 */  
function forward_write(array &$data) 
{      
    // get the user forward message
    $msg = $data['forward_message'];

    /*
     * driver save the data from $data (input values)
     */

   return PLUGIN_SUCCESS;
}
